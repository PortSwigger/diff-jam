## Burp Extension - Diff JAM
Adds a new tab to the Response pane of Repeater, which only shows the differences in the previous and current response.

A new context menu entry is also created to manually turn on, or off the extension.

Note: The extension is turned off by default (right click a IMessageEditor pane and turn on).
